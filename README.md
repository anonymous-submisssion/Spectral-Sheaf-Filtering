Please note that torch-geometric and its associated packages (torch-scatter, torch-sparse, torch-cluster) often require specific installation commands due to their dependency on the PyTorch version and CUDA compatibility. It's recommended to follow the official installation instructions provided by the PyTorch Geometric documentation to ensure proper setup.

Additionally, for the most accurate and up-to-date version compatibility, always refer to the official documentation of each library.
