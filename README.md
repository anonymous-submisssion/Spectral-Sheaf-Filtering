# Spectral Sheaf Filtering: A Topological Approach to Spatio-Temporal Modeling

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:

**Spectral Sheaf Filtering: A Topological Approach to Spatio-Temporal Modeling**

## Overview

We propose **Spectral Sheaf Filtering (SSF)** â€” a novel method that utilizes **sheaf theory** to model and learn spatio-temporal dependencies in structured data. SSF introduces a topological perspective into the design of neural networks for graph-based time series prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmarks.

Please note that torch-geometric and its associated packages (torch-scatter, torch-sparse, torch-cluster) often require specific installation commands due to their dependency on the PyTorch version and CUDA compatibility. It's recommended to follow the official installation instructions provided by the PyTorch Geometric documentation to ensure proper setup.
